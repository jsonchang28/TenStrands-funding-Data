The LBHS FLOW (Fire, Land, Ocean, Water) program was designed with the goal of helping students to possess a deep understanding and awareness of our unique natural environment and the value of mindful citizenship. In order to achieve this, the FLOW program is designed to weave together our student body, diverse academic disciplines, and community partners in a communal effort to strengthen our stewardship of our natural environment. FLOW stands for fire, land, ocean, and water--four environmental issues particularly relevant to Laguna Beach.
Students study FLOW topics successively through grades 9-12, having experiences across the curriculum, through a common read, and by attending community partner events. LBHS students now have the opportunity to earn the California State Seal of Civic Engagement and can share their FLOW projects to meet the criteria for this impressive distinction.","Sustainability

grade levels: 5th grade increased from 28% to 30% proficient, 8th grade improved from 24% to 29%, and 12th grade advanced from 21% to 27%.

Significant fiscal adjustments were made to align with the district's sustainability goals and legal requirements while maintaining educational quality. The most substantial change involved reducing the economic uncertainty reserve from 7% to the legally required minimum of 3%, freeing up approximately 4% of the district's budget for reinvestment in educational programs and facility improvements.

The increasing impacts of human caused climate change have directly affected our community with forest fires and unprecedented winter storms causing school closures. These experiences coupled with the ""Blueprint for Environmental Literacy: Educating every California student in, about and for the
Environment'' published by the California Department of Education led us to the development of this goal. Additionally, the Environmental Principles and Concepts are legislated per California Public Resources Code (Section 71301) and Education Code ( Section 51227.3). - Pg 37 The District set measurable goals for environmental literacy and sustainability. By Year 3, 50% of departments at BCE and SLVE and 60% of MS will meet “medium” on the Environmental Literacy Continuum, while HS targets 70%. Schools aim to incorporate Environmental Principles and Concepts across TK–5. Sustainability actions include reducing utilities by 10% from 2024–25 levels, despite baseline increases in water (+2,387 units), gas (+32,500 therms), and electricity (+258,514 kWh). Composting is targeted at 2 cans per day in Food Services and 1 per day at HS. All schools are expected to implement at least 2 sustainable actions in their SPSA by Year 3. Fleet electrification will rise from 9% in 2023–24 to 23% by Year 3. Additionally, 50% of classrooms are expected to participate in the Green Classroom Challenge, 75% of students will report outdoor learning experiences, and 75% will have had Environmental Literacy lessons. Climate change education is a new metric, with a 100% target for students in grades 1–12 by Year 3. – Pg 37–39 In 2024–25, Environmental Principles and Concepts were partially implemented, with professional development provided and leadership teams beginning site-level planning for full rollout. Climate change instruction was also partially implemented, with coursework covering causes, effects, and methods to mitigate and adapt, aligned with AB 285. The 5th grade science camp goal was fully implemented, with all students attending. The Seal of Civic Engagement in Environmental Literacy was only partially implemented, as development of a protocol was delayed by competing initiatives. The Sustainable Schools initiative was fully implemented, with all schools participating in the Green Classroom Challenge and building further systems for environmental stewardship. Campus Food Systems were fully implemented, expanding aquaponics and school garden produce use, increasing scratch cooking, and integrating nutrition services. Facilities maintenance was fully implemented, with all schools inspected to maintain a “Good” or better rating. Utilities reduction was also fully implemented, with monitoring through the Pelican Energy Management System, HVAC upgrades, solar installations, composting expansion, and landfill waste reduction. Finally, electric vehicle adoption was partially implemented, with an increase in the electric monitor vehicle fleet but not yet full expansion. – Pg 41 Effectiveness was mixed. Professional development supported Environmental Principles and Concepts, but a full rollout has yet to be achieved. Climate change education is now embedded into coursework as required by AB 285. All 5th graders attended science camp, but the Seal of Civic Engagement in Environmental Literacy was delayed. Hands-on programs, outdoor learning, and the Green Classroom Challenge showed strong participation, while infrastructure efforts improved efficiency through expanded campus food systems, greater use of local farm products, and facility upkeep. Waste reduction, water conservation, and expansion of electric vehicles also demonstrated progress. Overall, the district’s initiatives were effective in building environmental awareness, sustainability practices, and infrastructure improvements, but some areas such as full environmental literacy implementation and the Seal of Civic Engagement require further development. – Pg 42 For the coming year, the district will refine and streamline initiatives to strengthen progress toward sustainability and environmental goals. Efforts will focus on three key areas: first, designing and supporting environmental literacy by integrating environmental education across all grade levels and subjects so students gain the skills to be responsible stewards; second, expanding environmental engagement and enrichment through hands-on learning such as field studies, student-led projects, and extracurricular programs that build sustainability awareness; and third, advancing sustainable schools and environmentally conscious systems by embedding sustainable practices into facilities, resource management, and daily operations to create environmentally responsible school communities. – Pg 43 The district has three main environmental action areas. Design and Support Environmental Literacy focuses on integrating environmental education across all grade levels and subjects, with goals including curriculum materials and supports, curriculum development, training and professional development, Environmental Principles and Concepts, and the Seal of Civic Engagement. Environmental Engagement and Enrichment emphasizes hands-on learning through field studies, student-led projects, extracurricular programs that promote sustainability and environmental awareness, and Science Camp. Sustainable School Systems and Environmentally Conscious & Prudent Systems aim to embed sustainable practices into facilities, resource management, and daily operations by developing site action plans, improving food systems, supporting sustainable school facilities, expanding use of electric vehicles, managing waste, and advancing environmentally friendly utilities and operating systems. – Pg 43–44 Action 3.2, Environmental Engagement and Enrichment, addresses the need for full student participation by supporting unduplicated students so they can access the same enrichment opportunities as their peers. The focus is on hands-on learning experiences outside the classroom, enabling students to develop and apply knowledge through activities such as science camp participation and other enrichment programs. Progress is measured through student survey metrics. – Pg 48","environmental literacy, environmental principles and concepts, climate change education, sustainability actions, utilities reduction, composting, sustainable actions, fleet electrification, green classroom challenge, outdoor learning, environmental stewardship, aquaponics, school garden produce, scratch cooking, nutrition services, facilities maintenance, hvac upgrades, solar installations, waste reduction, water conservation, electric vehicles, field studies, student-led projects, extracurricular programs, sustainable school systems, resource management, food systems, environmentally friendly utilities, prudent systems, environmental engagement and enrichment, science camp, sustainability awareness",1,1,2020,$75000000.00,,,,,"March 3, 2020: To improve the quality of local schools; repair or replace roofs; construct Science/Engineering and Career Technical Education facilities; and make health and safety improvements; shall San Lorenzo Valley Unified School District�s measure be adopted authorizing $75,000,000 in bonds at legal interest rates, generating approximately $4.3 million annually while bonds are outstanding with levies of approximately 6 cents per $100 assessed value, with annual audits,  citizens� oversight, no money for salaries and all money for local projects?",,,,,,,,,,,10.50

Need: Ongoing feedback from education partners identifies the need to maintain the school garden. Although our garden focuses on ag science and nutrition, cross-curriculum to other content areas such as language arts, math, science, social studies and art are often a part of the learning. Additionally, the garden is an excellent location to model sustainable practices and present environmental education lessons. Ongoing education partner feedback indicated that agriculture is a cornerstone area for learning based on our District location and prominent ag industry. Unduplicated students have family who work in this industry, aspire to be in agricultural fields of study, and find the learning in the garden to be preparing them for life skills.
The District will provide a school garden for outdoor learning experience for SED, EL, and Hispanic students. This experience for these students will give opportunities to developlanguage, help to make healthy eating choices,and give facilitate culturally relevant lessons. We will use the garden for all students that is a learning environment used to promote real world, hands on experiences LEA-wide.
